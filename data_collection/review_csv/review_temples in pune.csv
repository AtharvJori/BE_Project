The temple is a confluence of three different periods, three different architectural styles. The temple is in Hemadpanti style but its shikhar is built in the form of a dome, influenced by Islamic architecture, complete with minars. It can be said that the architects did this to save this temple from destruction while it also shows the influence and amalgamation of the Hindu and Muslim way of life. The  wooden sabhamandap was built by the Peshwas in the Maratha style of architecture.\nYou can learn more about this temple and other historic places of Pune on YouTube in the series 'Gosht Punyachi' by Lokmat"", ""Situated in Pune's Somwar Peth, the Nageshwar Mandir is a revered temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, nestled in one of the city's renowned localities. Originally known as Shahpura, this area was inhabited by the Gosavis, who served as moneylenders in a time predating the existence of banks. Noteworthy landmarks in this locality include Shahu Udyan, Shahu Talav, and the Apollo Theatre.\n\nDating back to the 14th century, the Nageshwar Mandir derives its name from the Nageshwar Jyotirlinga, a temple mentioned in the ancient Sanskrit text Shiva Purana. Nageshwar, an epithet for Lord Shiva, and Jyotirlinga, symbolizing a radiant form of the deity, contribute to the temple's spiritual significance. The stone gabhara, or innermost holy shrine, suggests construction during the Yadava dynasty, while the wooden structural design follows the Peshwa architectural style, making it challenging to precisely date the temple's formation.\n\nOnce featuring a kunda, known as Nagatirtha or Nagendratirtha, the temple premises held a water reservoir believed by devotees to have healing properties for leprosy. Pilgrims would visit Nageshwar Mandir before heading to the Ganga in Benares, pouring water from the sacred river into the kunda upon their return. The Pune Municipal Corporation sealed this reservoir, which once covered a significant portion of the temple grounds, several decades ago. Surrounding the Nageshwar Mandir are four other temples dedicated to Ram, Vitthal, Maruti, and Vishnu.\n\nThe association of saints like Sant Namdev and Sant Tukaram adds to the temple's historical and spiritual significance. Sant Namdev's writings frequently mention the Nageshwar Mandir, referring to its sanctum sanctorum as Shivakshetra in many verses. Sant Tukaram's in-laws residing in the nearby village of Lohegaon prompted him to host kirtans (devotional songs) at the temple during his visits. These devotional performances garnered widespread popularity, attracting crowds from surrounding villages."", 'Very old & ancient temple in Peth area of pune city.\nYadav‚Äôs dynasty period & then renovated by Peshwas.\nVery huge Shiva temple.\nWell crafted wooden  sabha Mandap is worth the visit.\nVery large area surrounded by stone wall & multiple entry & exit gates.\nPeople who interested in history & ancient architecture, must visit here.\nLittle far from Main road but you follow the map, you can easily reach here.\nParking could be done here on different gates.\nFree entry for all.', 'Somwar Peth lies this 1000-year old temple dedicated to Shiva.', 'This place is so calm in the core city of Pune.\nNageshwar Temple, the temple of Lord Shiva, is located in Somwar Peth, Pune.
